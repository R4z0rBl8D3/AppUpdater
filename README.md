This can update your app
# How to use
You are going to want to make your program download this program. Then create a text file named 'Update.txt' and the first line should be the link to the download, it should be a zip file. And the next lines are the file/directory names (just the file/directory name, not the path). And then run the exe 'AppUpdater.exe'. 
The updater will leave a text file, if it says Successful, then that means that everything worked, and if it says Failed, then that means something went wrong.
